What features do I need?
- automatically determine the breakpoints for choropleth
- two choropleth maps 
- one scatterplot


Notes
- https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_mixer.asp
- Need to figure out how to create scatter plot by reading a csv file [done]

High (Implement it by 12/10)
- create a tract level csv file with case prevalence and relative debt burden to replace the existing 'hhinc_pop_tract_year.csv8'

Low (Implement it later)
